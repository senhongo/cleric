# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the decisions we've made and should hopefully serve as a record why for certain decisions were made.

## When and how to write an ADR?

The how is simple. There is a [template] provided, simply duplicate it and increment the number accordingly.

When is a bit more subjective. Usually, we start these from discussions in GitHub issues with the [exploration] label. When a conclusion is ready, we can then create the ADR.
